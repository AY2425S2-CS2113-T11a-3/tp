## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17** or above installed in your Computer and it is compatible with your device operating
   system (Mac or Windows).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T11a-3/tp/releases under latest release.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for InternSprint.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the  `java -jar InternSprint.jar` command to
   run the application.
   InternSprint should appear in your terminal window as shown below.

   >If you are a Mac user, do note that due to Mac Gatekeeper, this .jar file and its home folder cannot be in the
   `Downloads` directory, and will have to be relocated to another
   directory such as `Desktop` to bypass Mac's additional security check,
   hence if you see `Error: unable to access jarfile InternSprint.jar` simply relocate the directory. (You may bypass this
   quarantine on your Mac
   but this will require admin privileges and could be potentially be a security risk since anyone can now access this
   file, thus
   the relocation method is best).

    - Note the app will generate a data.txt file in this home folder which
      will be empty when the app is first launched.
   
      
5. Type the command in the terminal window and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing list and pressing Enter will list
   all stored tasks.
   Some example commands you can try:

   `list` : Lists all internships.

   `add general /c Google /r Human Resource /dept HR`  : Adds a general type of internship at Google, of Human 
    resources role, under HR department.

   `edit /index 1 /eli Year 2 students` : Adds description of eligibility to internship indexed at 1 in your list.

   `bye` : Exits the app.

## Saving the data

InternSprint  data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. 
There is no need to save manually.


## Editing the data file

InternSprint  data is saved automatically in `.json` format [JAR file location]/data/internships.txt. 
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> CAUTION!:
> The data file has particular .jsonformatting, any change to this file that violates this formatting could **corrupt the
data** and would require the data file to be deleted
> and started again. Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Simply copy the file [JAR file location]/data/internships.txt and transfer it to the secondary device in 
the same subdirectory of [JAR file location]/data. This will ensure your data is transferred, but keep in mind there
should be only one internships.txt in the location.
